## Harvest mobile application

The brand can offer premium or special prices to the farmers in their supply chain. We are trying to enable a secure legitimate way for these brands to reach the end farmers in the supply chain and distribute the premium to them. The farmers do not have a direct connection with the brands and they are connected to the brand through the processors and suppliers in the supply chain. The farmer will supply their commodities to the collector who can be a processor or just a supplier in the chain. Most of these farmers will have limited internet connectivity and we can not assume all of them can manage their transactions and stock via the web or mobile platforms. Since the brand can not reach them directly we have to distribute the premium via the first entity in contact with the farmer which is the collector. 
The application can do 3 major functionalities, add new farmers to the platform, transfer stock, and verify the premium transaction.  The user should able to do these functionalities without the internet and able to sync them with the server when they are connected to the network. The user will add farmer information using the mobile app (offline and online). The farmer is then later verified by the external verifier and supplied with an NFC or RF ID enabled identity card. This card can be used as a way to verify the identity of the farmer. Harvest mobile application accomplished with React Native and React ecosystem, just a single code base for both android and ios.
